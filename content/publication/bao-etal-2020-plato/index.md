abstract: Pre-training models have been proved effective for a wide range of natural
  language processing tasks. Inspired by this, we propose a novel dialogue generation
  pre-training framework to support various kinds of conversations, including chit-chat,
  knowledge grounded dialogues, and conversational question answering. In this framework,
  we adopt flexible attention mechanisms to fully leverage the bi-directional context
  and the uni-directional characteristic of language generation. We also introduce
  discrete latent variables to tackle the inherent one-to-many mapping problem in
  response generation. Two reciprocal tasks of response generation and latent act
  recognition are designed and carried out simultaneously within a shared network.
  Comprehensive experiments on three publicly available datasets verify the effectiveness
  and superiority of the proposed framework.
